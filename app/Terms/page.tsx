These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you (“you” or “your”) and Binary Crypto Options (“Binary Crypto Options”, “we”, “our” or “us”). The Terms govern your use of the Binance Services made available to you on or through the Platform or otherwise. Binance Services may be provided by Binance or, if specified in these Terms, any Product Terms or any additional terms, by any Binance Affiliate.

By registering for a Binary Crypto Options Account, accessing the Platform and/or using the Binary Crypto Options Services, you agree that you have read, understood and accepted these Terms, together with any additional documents or terms referred to in these Terms. You acknowledge and agree that you will be bound by and will comply with these Terms, as updated and amended from time to time.

If you do not understand and accept these Terms in their entirety, you should not register for a Binary Crypto Options Account or access or use the Platform or any Binary Crypto Options Service.

RISK WARNING

As with any asset, the value of Digital Assets can fluctuate significantly and there is a material risk of economic loss when buying, selling, holding or investing in Digital Assets. You should therefore consider whether trading or holding Digital Assets is suitable for you in light of your financial circumstances.

Further information on the risks associated with using the Binance Services is set out in our Risk Warning, which may be updated from time to time. You should read the Risk Warning carefully, however it does not explain all of the risks that may arise, or how such risks relate to your personal circumstances.

It is important that you fully understand the risks involved before making a decision to use the Binance Services.

We are not your broker, intermediary, agent or advisor and we have no fiduciary relationship or obligation to you in connection with any Transactions or other activities you undertake when using the Binance Services. We do not provide investment or consulting advice of any kind and no communication or information that we provide to you is intended as, or should be construed as, advice of any kind. 

It is your responsibility to determine whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you according to your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance and you are responsible for any associated loss or liability. We do not recommend that any Digital Asset should be bought, earned, sold or held by you. Before making the decision to buy, sell or hold any Digital Asset, you should conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor. We are not responsible for the decisions you make to buy, earn, sell or hold Digital Assets based on the information provided by us, including any losses you incur arising from those decisions.
